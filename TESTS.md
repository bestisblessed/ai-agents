# Agent Usage Examples

### General Development Tasks

#### 1. Web Development (Frontend)
```bash
./run.sh "Create a React component called TodoList.jsx that displays a list of todos with add, complete, and delete functionality. Include state management and basic styling with CSS."
```

#### 2. Backend/API Development
```bash
./run.sh "Create a Python Flask API with three endpoints: GET /users (returns list of users), POST /users (creates a new user with name and email), and GET /users/<id> (returns a specific user). Include error handling and JSON responses."
```

#### 3. Data Processing/Scripting
```bash
./run.sh "Create a Python script called analyze_logs.py that reads a log file, counts occurrences of each log level (INFO, WARNING, ERROR), and outputs a summary report to a JSON file."
```

### College Football Playoff Analysis Tasks

#### 4. Data Collection & Basic Analysis
```bash
./run.sh "Create a Python script that scrapes or reads college football playoff game data (teams, scores, stats) and calculates basic statistics like average points per game, win margins, and team performance rankings. Output results to a CSV file."
```

#### 5. Prediction Model
```bash
./run.sh "Build a Python script with a simple prediction model for college football playoff games. Use historical data features (win percentage, points scored/allowed, strength of schedule) to predict game outcomes. Include a function to make predictions for today's games and output probabilities."
```

#### 6. Statistical Analysis & Visualization
```bash
./run.sh "Create a Python script that analyzes college football playoff game data and generates visualizations: team performance charts, head-to-head comparisons, and trend analysis. Use matplotlib or plotly to create graphs showing offensive/defensive stats and save them as image files."
```

#### 7. Advanced Analytics Dashboard
```bash
./run.sh "Build a Python script that performs advanced analytics on college football playoff data: calculates advanced metrics (yards per play, turnover margin, red zone efficiency), creates a prediction model using multiple factors, and generates a formatted report with recommendations for today's games."
```

#### 8. Real-time Data Processing
```bash
./run.sh "Create a script that processes live college football playoff game data (or simulates it), tracks game progress, calculates win probability in real-time based on score differential and time remaining, and outputs updates to a JSON file."
```
